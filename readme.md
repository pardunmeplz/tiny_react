# Tiny React

A minimal React-like library built from scratch in TypeScript, with support for functional components, hooks (`useState`), and a basic virtual DOM.
The project is a study to understand React's inner workings.

## Features

- Functional components
- `useState` hook with stable state across renders
- Basic virtual DOM rendering ( without any diffing )
- Component tree with unique IDs for consistent hook tracking
- Nested components and children support
- Automatic re-render on state update
